        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a begginer software engineer, currently working to get certified through coding temple to become a frontend developer. I am passionate about learning how to code more because I hope to one day create a video game with ai characters that are always evolving and changing so it's not the same lines for every player a massive mmorpg. I know this will be hard to accomplish but I am eager to learn new skills and improve my abilities to accomplish my dream. </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my kids, going on hikes, and gaming with my friends from different states.</p>
